1.37.1. Goal/Own Goal
Different governing bodies have different rules, and where possible OPTA (https://soccerstats.info/) works with the relevant people to reflect their official decisions on goal scorers.
Regarding deflections, normally a goal is awarded if the original attempt is on target. An own goal is usually awarded if the attempt is off target and deflected into the goal by an opponent.
1.37.2. Shots
A shot target is defined as any clear attempt to score that:
Goes into the net regardless of intent.
Is a clear attempt to score that would have gone into the net but for being saved by the goalkeeper or is stopped by a player who is the last-man with the goalkeeper having no chance of preventing the goal (last line block).
Goes over or wide of the goal without making contact with another player.
Would have gone over or wide of the goal but for being stopped by a goalkeeper’s save or by an outfield player.
Directly hits the frame of the goal and a goal is not scored.
Blocked shots are not counted as shots.

Goes into the net regardless of intent.
Is a clear attempt to score that would have gone into the net but for being saved by the goalkeeper or is stopped by a player who is the last-man with the goalkeeper having no chance of preventing the goal (last line block).
Shots directly hitting the frame of the goal are not counted as shots on goal, unless the ball goes in and is awarded as a goal.
Shots blocked by another player, who is not the last-man, are not counted as shots on goal.
1.37.4. Goal Assist
The final touch (pass, pass-cum-shot or any other touch) leading to the recipient of the ball scoring a goal. If the final touch (as defined in this clause) is deflected by an opposition player, the initiator is only given a goal assist if the receiving player was likely to receive the ball without the deflection having taken place. Own goals, directly taken free kicks, direct corner goals and penalties do not get an assist awarded.
1.37.5. Tackle 
A tackle is defined as where a player connects with the ball in a ground challenge where he successfully takes the ball away from the player in possession.
The tackled player must clearly be in possession of the ball before the tackle is made.
A tackle won is deemed to be where the tackler or one of his team-mates regains possession as a result of the challenge, or that the ball goes out of play and is “safe”;
A tackle lost is where a tackle is made but the ball goes to an opposition player.
Both are deemed as successful tackles however, the outcome of the tackle (won or lost) is different based on where the ball goes after the tackle.
It is not a tackle, when a player cuts out a pass by any means.
