Therefore, the senior management has implemented systems and procedures that meet the standards set forth by the relevant KYC legislation in Anjouan.</p>\n<p>The Company adheres to and complies with “Know your customer” principles, which aim to prevent financial crime and money laundering through client identification and due diligence.</p>\n<p>The Company reserves the right, at any time, to ask for any KYC documentation it deems necessary to determine the identity and location of a user in www.Yummygame.io. We reserve the right to restrict the service, payment, or withdrawal until identity is sufficiently determined, or for any other reason in our sole discretion based on the legal framework.</p>\n<p>We take a risk-based approach and perform strict due diligence checks and ongoing monitoring of all clients, customers, and transactions. As per the money laundering regulations, we utilize three stages of due diligence checks, depending on the risk, transaction, and customer type:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>SDD: simplified due diligence is used in instances of extremely low-risk transactions that do not meet the required thresholds.</li>\n    <li>CDD: customer due diligence is the standard for due diligence checks, used in most cases for verification and identification.</li>\n    <li>EDD: Enhanced Due Diligence is used for high-risk customers, large transactions, or special cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Separately and in addition to the above, when a user makes an aggregate lifetime total of deposits exceeding EUR 5,000 or requests a withdrawal of any amount inside the www.Yummygame.io or attempts to or completes a transaction that is deemed suspicious, then it is compulsory for them to complete the full KYC process.</p>\n<p>During this process, the user will have to input some basic details about themselves and then upload:</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>A copy of Government Issued Photo ID (in some cases front and back depending on the ID document)</li>\n    <li>A selfie of themselves holding the ID doc</li>\n    <li>A bank statement/Utility Bill</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Guideline for the “KYC Process”</h2>\n<ol>\n    <li><strong>Proof of ID</strong>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Signature Is there.</li>\n            <li>Country is not one of the following Restricted Countries: Austria, France and its territories, Germany, Netherlands and its territories, Spain, Union of Comoros, United Kingdom, USA and its territories, All FATF Blacklisted countries, any other jurisdictions deemed prohibited by Anjouan Offshore Financial Authority.</li>\n            <li>Full Name matches client’s name.</li>\n            <li>Document does not expire in the next 3 months.</li>\n            <li>Owner is over 18 years of age.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Proof of Residence</strong>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Bank Statement or Utility Bill</li>\n            <li>Country is not one of the following Restricted Countries: Austria, France and its territories, Germany, Netherlands and its territories, Spain, Union of Comoros, United Kingdom and its territories, USA and its territories, All FATF Blacklisted countries, any other jurisdictions deemed prohibited by Anjouan Offshore Financial Authority.</li>\n            <li>Full Name matches client’s name and is same as in proof of ID.</li>\n            <li>Date of Issue: In the last 3 months</li>\n        </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Selfie with ID</strong>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Holder is the same as in the ID document above.</li>\n            <li>ID document is the same as in “1”.

If you forfeit the bonus, all bonus funds associated with the bonus (i.e., profits - winnings associated with the bonus) will also be removed.</li>\n    <li>Each game has its wagering percentage: original games, baccarat = 0%; live casino, video poker, table games, and other games = 5%; slots, video slots, scratch cards = 100%.</li>\n    <li>When you withdraw your bonus, your winnings will be subtracted from your rollover contribution percentage. For example, if Original games contribution rate is 0%, the winnings from the original game (winnings - wager) will be withdrawn.</li>\n    <li>Unless otherwise stated in the conditions of a specific bonus, the default wagering requirements for bonuses are 40 times the received bonus amount. Any profits derived from bonus spins are considered bonus funds and must be wagered per the wagering requirements attached to the specific bonus.</li>\n    <li>Bonuses must be wagered within 7 days of activation. Failure to complete wagering within this period will result in the bonus amount (including the initial deposit) and potential winnings being forfeited.</li>\n    <li>When bonuses are active, the maximum wager amount depends on the player's VIP level.</li>\n    <li>Casino bonuses cannot be withdrawn until all conditions for the specific bonus are met.</li>\n    <li>If players are deemed to use minimum-risk or risk-free betting strategies to reclaim bonuses, the bonus, original deposit amount, and all subsequent profits are at risk of being removed.

HON plays do not contribute to wagering.</li>\n    <li>It is prohibited to delay any game rounds (including free spins and bonus features) until wagering requirements are no longer applicable or to make new deposits while free spins or bonus features remain in the game. Players doing so agree to have profits related to the bonus voided.</li>\n    <li>If a bonus is already activated, players cannot request the withdrawal of the deposit amount until the bonus wagering requirements are met.</li>\n    <li>Bonus funds and winnings are forfeited upon bonus expiration.</li>\n    <li>Only one bonus can be claimed and activated per player at a time.</li>\n    <li>All withdrawals are subject to internal audits. The casino reserves all rights to invalidate bonuses or winnings for failed audits. Players pre-consent to this.</li>\n    <li>If profits are credited to your account due to technical errors, human mistakes, or other reasons unrelated to you, the amount remains the casino's property and will be debited from your account.</li>\n    <li>If you withdraw funds that do not belong to you before the casino recognizes the error, the mistakenly paid amount will be considered your debt to the casino, without prejudice to other legal remedies and actions. If a wrongful credit occurs, you must immediately notify the casino via email.</li>\n    <li>Bonus rounds and free spins are not eligible for jackpot bonuses under the rules of the casino software provider. Only actual rounds qualify for jackpot bonuses.</li>\n    <li>The casino reserves the right to verify jackpot winnings exceeding $200,000 processed in your account.</li>\n    <li>Using bonus funds solely to progress bonus stages is prohibited. For instance, if bonus or cash funds are used solely to progress stages (e.g., collecting 9 out of 10 coins to reach a bonus feature), and the final stage (e.g., collecting the last coin to play the bonus feature) is completed with cash bets, and the bonus funds are forfeited, lost, or converted into cash, all profits obtained during that time may be invalidated.</li>\n    <li>Activating a new bonus will remove previously activated bonuses.</li>\n<br></ol>\n\n<h2>YummyGame Bonus System</h2>\n4-Tier Deposit Bonus Policy\n1.
